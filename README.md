# Concatenate for AI

A powerful VS Code extension that makes it easy to bundle multiple files into a single formatted document, optimized for use with AI tools like Google Gemini 2.5, ChatGPT, Claude, and other large language models (LLMs).

## Why You Need This

Working with Large Language Models (LLMs) often requires providing multiple code files for context. This extension solves common challenges:

- **Streamline AI-assisted programming** by quickly assembling relevant project files
- **Preserve file paths** for proper context when discussing code with AI assistants
- **Maintain code formatting and syntax highlighting** with proper language tags

## Features

### Convenient Output Option

**Concatenate to New Document** - Creates a new unsaved document with all your selected files properly formatted

## How to Use

1. Select multiple files in the VS Code Explorer (using Ctrl/Cmd+Click)
2. Right-click and choose:
   - **Concatenate selected files as new document** (allows direct editing)
3. Copy the resulting output to your favorite AI tool

## Output Format

Files are concatenated with proper Markdown code fencing and language detection.
