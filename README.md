## Why You Need This

Working with Large Language Models (LLMs) often requires providing multiple code files for context. This extension solves common challenges:

- **Streamline AI-assisted programming** by quickly assembling relevant project files
- **Preserve file paths** for proper context when discussing code with AI assistants
- **Maintain code formatting and syntax highlighting** with proper language tags

## Features

### Two Convenient Output Options

1. **Concatenate to Viewer** - Generates formatted output in a dedicated viewer with one-click copy functionality
2. **Concatenate to New Document** - Creates a new unsaved document with all your selected files properly formatted

## How to Use

1. Select multiple files in the VS Code Explorer (using Ctrl/Cmd+Click)
2. Right-click and choose either:
   - **Concatenate selected files** (for copy-friendly viewer)
   - **Concatenate selected files as new document** (for direct editing)
3. Copy the resulting output to your favorite AI tool

## Output Format

Files are concatenated with proper Markdown code fencing and language detection.
