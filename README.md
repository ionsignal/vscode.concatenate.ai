# Concatenate for AI

A powerful VS Code extension that makes it easy to bundle multiple files into a single formatted document, optimized for use with AI tools like Gemini 2.5, ChatGPT, Claude, and other large language models (LLMs).

## Why You Need This

Working with Large Language Models (LLMs) often requires providing multiple code files for context. This extension solves common challenges:

- **Overcome token limitations** by efficiently formatting multiple files into a single shareable document
- **Maintain code formatting and syntax highlighting** with proper language tags
- **Streamline AI-assisted programming** by quickly assembling relevant project files
- **Preserve file paths** for proper context when discussing code with AI assistants

## Features

### âœ¨ Two Convenient Output Options

1. **Concatenate to Viewer** - Generates formatted output in a dedicated viewer with one-click copy functionality
2. **Concatenate to New Document** - Creates a new unsaved document with all your selected files properly formatted

### ðŸš€ Perfect for AI Programming Workflows

- **AI Code Reviews**: Bundle related files to get comprehensive feedback
- **Debugging with AI**: Include all relevant context for troubleshooting
- **System Architecture Design**: Share multiple implementation files for AI analysis
- **Learning New Codebases**: Ask an AI to explain relationships between selected files

## How to Use

1. Select multiple files in the VS Code Explorer (using Ctrl/Cmd+Click)
2. Right-click and choose either:
   - **Concatenate selected files** (for copy-friendly viewer)
   - **Concatenate selected files as new document** (for direct editing)
3. Copy the resulting output to your favorite AI tool

## Output Format

Files are concatenated with proper Markdown code fencing and language detection:

## Use Cases

- **Context Building**: Help AI understand your project structure
- **Bug Fixing**: Include related files when diagnosing issues
- **Code Review**: Bundle implementation with tests for better AI feedback
- **Refactoring**: Show before/after changes across multiple files
- **Documentation**: Generate comprehensive file documentation with AI
